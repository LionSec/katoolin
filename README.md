# Usage
- Typing the number of a tool will install it
- Typing 0 will install all Kali Linux tools
- back : Go back
- gohome : Go to the main menu
- By installing armitage , you will install metasploit only. its not shipped by default anymore :/

# Warning
once you installed the tools you needed please remove all Kali-linux repositories as this can seriously fuck up your install if you try to update 

# I have some questions!

# Author
this project was forked from https://github.com/LionSec/katoolin/

i just added some fix as the project dont seems to be actively maintained anymore

# TODO
- improve UI (reduce the number of step to install a package, auto add the repo and delete once installed)
- move to python 3
